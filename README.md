# My ZSH Configurations

This configuration is for my macOS workstation and therefore contain some macOS-specific code and commands.

## Quick Start

```sh
bash <(curl --fail --show-error --silent --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnxdxt/tmp/main/init.sh)
```

## Plugin Management

If your default shell is not `zsh`, make it zsh and open a new terminal and plugins will automatically start installing.

I use [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit) with Turbo Mode to accelerate the loading and checking of ZSH plugins.
Thus, `zinit` will be install be installed via the `init.sh` script above.
